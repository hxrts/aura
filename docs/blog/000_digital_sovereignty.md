## Sovereignty

Most of the time, when people talk about the internet, they talk about tools, platforms, networks. The focus is on features and products.

What is harder to see is that our basic social form is changing.

We now live in a post-internet culture. Many of our closest relationships, our work, our politics, and our sense of who we are move across borders by default. We belong to overlapping communities that are not contained by a city or a country. We coordinate inside group chats, multiplayer games, forums, and protocols as if that were the most natural thing in the world.

This is more than “spending more time online.” It is a new way of relating. A new “we” is forming that presumes the existence of global networks.

This new “we” is not yet an institution. It does not have a constitution, a clear membership rule, or a formal way to act in the world. It is more like a will. A desire to relate to one another in a different way. A feeling that the old categories of citizenship and territory do not fully match how our lives are actually organized.

The question is what it would take for this new social form to become collectively self-determining. In other words, what would it take for networked communities to move from being just “users” inside other people’s systems to being political subjects in their own right.

To answer that, we need to talk about sovereignty, accountability, and the question of how personhood is decided.

## Sovereignty and Personhood

Sovereignty is often defined as “supreme authority within a territory.” That sounds abstract, but it points at something concrete. Who gets to set the rules in a given space. Who can change them. Who can say yes or no when interests collide.

Territory here does not have to mean land. It can be a jurisdiction, a legal domain, an institutional boundary, a protocol, or any shared space where behavior is regulated.

Identity then becomes a political question. Before a group can be sovereign, someone has to decide who belongs to that group. Someone has to decide which people are visible to the system, which are entitled to rights, and which voices matter when decisions are made.

To be recognized as part of a “people” is to be seen as a subject of rules and as a potential source of authority. To be excluded is to be invisible to the process that shapes your life. In that sense, sovereignty and identity are intertwined. Sovereignty answers “who rules here.” Identity answers “who exists here.”

This is not just theory. It shows up in border regimes, citizenship law, and indigenous struggles. It shows up when a platform silently bans certain users. It shows up when a protocol has no notion of some group’s existence at all. If you are not modeled, you cannot be protected, and you certainly cannot rule.

Any project that cares about collective self-determination has to care about both. Sovereignty without attention to who is recognized can produce domination. Identity without any way to act together can produce frustration and fragmentation.

## Internal Sovereignty: How Groups Control Themselves

When people talk about sovereignty, they often think about the state. This is useful, because the modern state is a familiar example of internal sovereignty. It answers the question of how authority is organized inside a political body.

There are three structural questions here.

First, how does sovereign authority originate. At some point there is a founding moment. People come together and form a “we.” They accept some process of rule making. This is often described as a social contract. Legitimacy comes from consent, from shared belief, and from the recognition that this structure is allowed to speak in the name of the group.

Second, how is this authority perpetuated. The founding moment is not enough. Power has to remain tethered to the people it claims to represent. That means there must be ways to renew or withdraw consent. There must be methods for changing the rules, updating the “spec” of the institution, and making sure that decisions reflect more than the interests of a small inner circle.

Third, what happens in exceptional situations. Every real system faces crises. Wars. Economic shocks. Technical failures. Security incidents. Someone will claim the right to step outside normal rules “for the greater good.” How that power is granted, and how it is later reviewed or revoked, tells you a lot about the real structure of internal sovereignty.

When these pieces are healthy, internal sovereignty can support freedom. When they fail, authority drifts away from the base. You get institutions that become “too big to fail,” that continue to exist even when they no longer serve their public. You get bureaucratic violence where no one is personally responsible, yet harm is produced in a routine way. You get emergency measures that never quite end.

The key point is that internal sovereignty is not just about who sets the rules today. It is about how those rules are formed, maintained, and contested over time.

## External Sovereignty: Life Among Others

No group exists alone. Even a powerful state has neighbors, trading partners, opponents, and allies. The same is true for any protocol or platform. Each lives in an environment filled with other centers of control.

External sovereignty describes how a group relates to this outside world. It is about freedom from external domination, but also about the choices a group makes when it enters into relations with others.

Here, recognition matters. A border is not real only because insiders believe it. Outsiders also have to acknowledge that, within some domain, “this is your call.” In the classical state system this shows up in diplomatic recognition and non-interference. In network contexts it shows up in how protocols federate, how they respect or ignore each other’s rules, and how data and users move across boundaries.

External sovereignty has its own structure.

One part is jurisdictional. Where does one system’s authority stop and another’s begin. Who is responsible when actions cross those lines. Another part involves trade-offs. Often a group will give up some direct control in one area in order to gain greater capacity to act in another. For example, states may agree to common standards or treaties that limit their unilateral options, but in return gain shared infrastructure or reduced conflict. Protocols might adopt shared formats to gain interoperability and network effects.

There is also the problem of network coercion. On paper, a group or an individual may be free to exit a relationship. In practice, deep dependencies can make that exit almost impossible. Money, identity, social ties, and security all create forms of lock-in. At large scale, coordination costs can make alternate choices invisible or unthinkable.

This is why it is important to say that sovereignty is not the same thing as independence. It is not a pure state of isolation. It is a web of negotiated recognition and constraint. A group may actually gain more meaningful self-determination by entering into certain relationships, even if that means giving up some formal control. The reverse is also possible.

In a networked world, these external relations are dense and constant. That makes the structure of external sovereignty more visible, and more contested, than before.

## Accountability as Reciprocal Control

Sovereignty answers who has the right to decide. Accountability answers how that right is kept aligned with the people affected by those decisions.

Accountability is often treated as a vague ideal. In practice it has a clear structure. There are two linked elements.

The first is answerability. An institution must be able to explain its actions to those it governs. It must identify who did what, under which rule, and for which reasons. This involves transparency, traceability, and public justification.

The second is enforcement. People must have credible means to change institutional behavior when it diverges from shared norms or explicit rules. This can happen through internal processes, such as courts or governance votes. It can also happen through external pressure, such as protest, refusal, or exit.

These two elements rely on each other. Enforcement without answerability is blind punishment. Answerability without enforcement is theater.

Accountability is reciprocal because control flows in both directions. Institutions regulate people’s behavior. At the same time, people regulate institutions, directly or indirectly. When the second part breaks down, institutions may retain formal authority, but they lose power in a deeper sense. They no longer rest on a living base of support. As that support erodes, they are tempted to rely on force or manipulation.

In a post-internet environment, this reciprocity is under pressure. Many vital institutions, from platforms to financial systems, have global reach but very weak mechanisms for answerability and enforcement from below. Users can complain, but cannot easily change the rules that govern them. Migration is often costly or symbolic.

Rebuilding accountability in this context means designing structures where reciprocal control is not an afterthought, but a core property.

## Network Protocols as Emerging Institutions

Network protocols are often treated as neutral plumbing. They are seen as just a way to send messages or synchronize data. That view hides their institutional character.

Every protocol defines a space of interaction. It decides who can join, how they are identified, how messages are routed, what counts as valid behavior, and how misbehavior is handled. It encodes procedures for change, whether formal or informal. It creates defaults for privacy, visibility, and control.

In that sense, protocols already act as regulatory systems. They are institutions in waiting.

They also have internal sovereignty. Somewhere, there is a path by which the protocol can be changed. It might be a standards body, a foundation, a company, an open source community, or a small group of maintainers. There are also implicit rules about whose needs are prioritized. For example, whether the protocol is designed around operators, developers, or end users. This shapes who is effectively recognized, and who is just an object in the system.

Protocols also have a kind of external sovereignty. They meet other protocols and platforms at boundaries. They interoperate, federate, or compete. They may import and export data. They may depend on base layers like DNS or payment rails. They may expose their users to external law in different ways.

Under normal conditions, these sovereign structures are easy to overlook. They become visible during stress.

A moderation crisis reveals who can remove content or users, and what appeals are possible. A security breach shows who can coordinate a response, and whether users are informed and protected. A disputed change in rules shows whether participants have any real voice, or whether they simply adapt or leave.

In those moments, you can see whether there is internal accountability. You can see how external pressures shape choices. You can see whether the protocol treats participants as citizens of a shared space, or as passive endpoints.

If we take network protocols seriously as institutions, then their design is not a neutral technical choice. It is a form of political design.

## Network Sovereignty and Autonomy

Network sovereignty is a way to name the authority that arises inside protocol defined spaces. It is the capacity of network native communities to set and enforce their own rules within digital territory. It also describes how these communities relate to states, markets, and other networks.

The aim is not sovereignty for its own sake. The aim is autonomy. Autonomy has two sides. It is the capacity of individuals and groups to act according to their own purposes. It is also the field of action that their environment makes available. A person can feel free only if both are present.

A good network institution should expand this field of action. It should give people tools to express intent and to coordinate at scale. It should reduce their exposure to arbitrary control. That includes the subtle forms of domination that arise from surveillance, lock in, and opaque decision making.

To do that, network sovereignty needs structure on the inside. Protocols need clear answers to basic questions. Who can change the rules. Who is recognized as a participant and in what role. How crises are handled without granting permanent emergency powers. These choices decide how internal sovereignty works in practice and how it can be contested.

Network sovereignty also needs structure on the outside. Every protocol touches others at its edges. It may share data, interoperate, or rely on common infrastructure. In each case there is a negotiation. The protocol can gain new capacities through these links, but it can also lose control. The design question is how to relate outward without giving up the ability of the community to steer its own course.

Accountability is what ties these pieces together. Network institutions should be answerable to the people they affect. Participants should be able to see how decisions are made and by whom. They should also have real means to enforce shared norms. That can include formal governance, social pressure, or the credible option to move their activity elsewhere.

Protocol design then starts to look like constitutional work. It is not only about efficiency or scale. It is about who counts as a subject, who can speak for the group, and which paths exist when things go wrong. It is about building systems where people do not just inhabit a space, but can help govern it.

We are already living inside networked forms of life. Our projects, conflicts, and solidarities cross borders by default. Network sovereignty offers a framework for turning this diffuse social fact into durable, accountable institutions. If we care about collective self determination in the digital sphere, this is where the work begins.
