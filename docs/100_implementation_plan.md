# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the complete implementation strategy for Aura, consolidating all scattered implementation discussions into a coherent phased approach. 

**Core Principles**: Throughout all phases, we maintain unwavering commitment to **concise, clean, elegant code**. We accept **zero legacy code**, **zero backwards compatibility code**, and **zero migration code**. Every line of code must serve a clear purpose and align with our architectural vision.

## Phase 0: Foundation Cleanup & Identity Core Refinement

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Primary Goal**: Establish a pristine foundation by removing all technical debt and solidifying the identity core

### Phase 0.1: Technical Debt Elimination (1 week)

**Context**: The current codebase contains significant technical debt that violates our clean code principles. This must be eliminated before any new development.

**Removal Targets** (Zero tolerance for legacy code):

1. **Legacy Compatibility Code**:
   - Remove `simple()` method in `ContextCapsule` (legacy compatibility)
   - Eliminate all commented-out code and old implementations
   - Remove temporary migration code (`now!` macro and similar workarounds)
   - Clean up all `#[allow(unused_imports)]` and `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations

2. **Phase 4 Code** (Out of scope for identity core):
   - Remove chunking, indexing, and manifest systems from storage crate
   - Eliminate all commented Phase 4 features
   - Remove placeholder storage implementations not needed for Phase 0

3. **Stub/Mock Infrastructure**:
   - Replace or remove stub transport implementations
   - Eliminate mock functions like `create_mock_ledger` unless essential for testing
   - Remove placeholder signatures and temporary implementations

4. **TODO Debt**:
   - Resolve all TODO comments: implement the feature or remove the code
   - Remove Phase-specific comments that don't align with current goals
   - Clean up deprecated function references

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero warnings from `cargo clippy --deny warnings`
- No commented-out code remains in the codebase
- All TODO comments either resolved or have clear implementation plans
- Documentation build passes without warnings

**Code Quality Standards** (Enforced throughout):
- Every function has a single, clear purpose
- No god objects or monolithic implementations
- Clear separation of concerns at all levels
- Minimal dependencies between modules

### Phase 0.2: Identity Core Solidification (2-3 weeks)

**Context**: Refine and solidify the threshold identity system as the unshakeable foundation for all future phases.

**Implementation Areas**:

1. **FROST Threshold Signatures**:
   - Ensure robust Ed25519 threshold signature implementation
   - Clean choreographic coordination for signing operations
   - Deterministic key generation with proper entropy management

2. **Deterministic Key Derivation (DKD)**:
   - P2P DKD protocol implementation (not single-device)
   - Context-based key derivation with proper separation
   - Integration with choreographic coordination layer

3. **Session Management**:
   - Session epoch bumping for credential invalidation
   - Presence ticket infrastructure with proper validation
   - Clean integration between epochs and ticket validity

4. **CRDT Ledger**:
   - Automerge-based account ledger with proper event signing
   - Event replay and state reconstruction mechanisms
   - Nonce tracking for replay attack prevention

**Success Criteria**:
- New device can join account, participate in signing, and be removed cleanly
- Session epoch bumping invalidates all previous presence tickets
- All threshold operations work reliably with deterministic testing
- CRDT ledger maintains consistency across all operations

**Elegance Requirements**:
- Protocol implementations are concise and self-documenting
- No redundant code or unnecessary abstractions
- Clear data flow from identity through protocols to ledger
- Minimal cognitive load for developers working with the APIs

## Phase 1: Storage MVP & Transport Integration

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Primary Goal**: Add secure, capability-driven storage with real transport integration

### Phase 1.1: Capability-Driven Storage (2-3 weeks)

**Context**: Implement the minimum viable storage system that demonstrates capability-based access control without compromising our clean code standards.

**Implementation**:

1. **Core Storage Engine**:
   - Encrypted chunk storage with inline metadata
   - Content-addressed storage with BLAKE3 hashing
   - Capability-based access control integration

2. **Proof-of-Storage**:
   - Challenge-response protocol for data integrity verification
   - Cryptographic proofs using device signatures
   - Integration with session epoch for freshness

3. **Quota Management**:
   - LRU eviction policy for cache management
   - Per-account and per-device quota tracking
   - Storage pressure handling with clean eviction

**Elegance Standards**:
- Storage operations are atomic and clearly defined
- Access control logic is separate from storage mechanics
- No complex state machines or confusing abstractions
- Clean error handling with descriptive error types

### Phase 1.2: Transport Integration (2 weeks)

**Context**: Replace stub transport with production-ready implementation while maintaining transport abstraction.

**Implementation**:
- Production transport adapter (iroh or HTTPS relay)
- Presence ticket validation at transport layer
- Session epoch integration for connection management
- Clean transport abstraction preserving choreographic coordination

**Success Criteria**:
- Example application can store and retrieve data using clean APIs
- Transport correctly rejects connections without valid presence tickets
- Quota system prevents unbounded cache growth
- All operations work with deterministic testing

**Zero Compromise Standards**:
- No performance hacks or shortcuts in implementation
- Clean separation between transport and application logic
- Proper error propagation without complex error mapping
- Transport failures don't corrupt application state

## Phase 2: Guardian Recovery & Advanced Capabilities

- No god objects, monolithic functions, or complex state machines
- Clean separation of concerns at all architectural levels
- Minimal cognitive load for developers and maintainers

### Testing Excellence
- All code runs unmodified in deterministic simulation
- Byzantine fault injection validates protocol robustness
- Effect injection enables controllable time and randomness
- Comprehensive test coverage without sacrificing code clarity

### Documentation Standards
- Self-documenting code with clear naming and structure
- Comprehensive API documentation with usage examples
- Architecture documentation that explains design decisions
- No code comments explaining what the code does (code should be clear)

## Success Metrics
