# Network Sovereignty

- Sovereignty is a framework for understanding the architecture of control in systems that regulate collective behavior
- We call these regulatory systems “institutions”
- The particular institutions we’re interested in today are crypto protocols
- The degree of sovereignty held by an institution constitutes its capacity to self-govern and act within its asserted limits
- A blockchain is delimited by its consensus protocol, along with a shared commitment to a set of social practices
- In order to evaluate sovereignty we need to think about who is in control during steady-state — but also under extenuating circumstances, over long timespans, and through various means of indirection
- In this sense one must bring an expansive lens to any analysis of sovereignty, understand the meta
- Because sovereignty operates at the apex of control, it encompasses aspects beyond what one might typically consider “protocol design”
    - A state asserting jurisdiction to impose overriding legal authority
    - Market forces, which might be the exchange rate of key assets, or effects at a distance from exogenous derivatives
    - Prevailing norms, including user expectations, or interoperability standards
    - Or fundamental architectural constraints, including the limitations of a geographically distributed system, or the affordances of deployed cryptographic primitives
- It’s important to distinguish sovereignty from independence, as sovereignty is necessarily achieved through the recognition of others — a border is only real to the extent that insiders believe and outsiders recognize that belief
- Moreover sovereignty as a means toward collective self-determination isn’t zero sum — establishing a trade-route may result in some amount of economic dependence (giving up a degree of sovereignty) while at the same time providing the resources to remove other dependencies and take greater action 
- Sovereignty is not a good in itself, we should keep in mind sovereignty has a dual history
- One of collective liberation, one of imperialism and disenfranchisement — both originate with sovereignty
- The specifics of who a sovereign institution recognizes as valid, which among them expresses control, and how they choose act in the world all matter
- Needless to say sovereignty is a complex topic—fraught, but incredibly powerful—and absolutely essential to what all of us are doing here in crypto.

## Life Post-Internet

We often describe our world as “networked,” yet we still imagine politics as if it were contained inside nation states and their borders. Digital platforms and protocols are treated as secondary infrastructure, layered beneath law and policy that remain territorial at their core. This framing misses a quieter shift that has already changed how collective life is organized.

Many of our relationships, conflicts, and projects now unfold in spaces that are not easily mapped to a city or a country. People coordinate work, friendships, and political activity through chats, platforms, and shared technical systems that stretch across jurisdictions as a matter of course. These environments shape identity and affiliation as directly as any local institution. They host publics that act together, argue, and persist across time.

We can say that a network shaped form of collective life has emerged. It is not yet codified in constitutions or formal charters, yet it is real in practice. The question is whether this form can become self determining, rather than remaining subject to remote owners and opaque infrastructures. To answer that we need to connect political theory with digital architecture. The concepts of sovereignty and accountability offer a way to do this.

## Sovereignty, Identity, and the Question of Who Counts

Sovereignty is often defined as “supreme authority within a territory.” Behind the legal language is a simple problem. In any shared space, who gets to set the rules, and who can change them when circumstances shift. For Hobbes, the sovereign was the figure that speaks for the collective and commands obedience. Contemporary international law treats sovereignty as final authority over a jurisdiction.

If we ask who rules, we must also ask who is included in that “who.” Identity becomes a political question. Before authority can operate in the name of a people, someone must decide who belongs to that people. Weber’s account of legitimacy, whether rooted in tradition, charisma, or legality, presumes a prior act of recognition. Certain humans are taken to be the relevant audience and the relevant source of consent. Others are quietly treated as objects of regulation.

To be recognized as a subject of rules is to be visible to the system and to have standing within it. Those who are not recognized live under decisions that they cannot meaningfully influence. The pattern appears in formal exclusions, such as non citizens or unrecognized indigenous groups, and in digital contexts where some actors are treated as pure data. Sovereignty and identity therefore move together. Sovereignty asks who decides. Identity asks whose existence is counted in that decision.

## Internal Sovereignty: The Architecture of Rule

Internal sovereignty describes how authority is organized inside an institution. The modern state is the canonical example, but the same questions apply to corporations, platforms, and protocols. There is an initial process through which authority arises. There are mechanisms that carry it forward. There are exceptional moments when normal rules are suspended.

The first problem is origination. Social contract theorists describe people who give up certain freedoms in exchange for protection and recognition. Weber instead emphasizes patterns of belief that stabilize and render authority legitimate. In either case, the institution does not generate its own right to rule. That right is conferred, whether explicitly or tacitly, by those who accept its claims.

The second problem is continuation. Authority must remain tethered to some ongoing form of consent if it is to support freedom rather than domination. Berlin’s distinction between positive and negative liberty is helpful here. Internal sovereignty can either expand people’s ability to act together or compress it. The difference depends on whether there are real means to revise rules, change leaders, and reinterpret the collective project.

There is also the problem of exception. Schmitt’s claim that the sovereign is the one who decides on the exception points to a structural fact. Every system faces crises. Someone will claim the right to act outside normal constraints for the sake of survival or order. The way an institution grants, reviews, and limits this power reveals its actual structure of rule. It shows who is trusted to act for the whole, and who can resist if that trust is broken.

## External Sovereignty: Life Among Others

No institution exists alone. Even the most powerful state operates in an environment shaped by other nations, markets, or physical constraints. External sovereignty describes how authority is negotiated across these boundaries. It involves recognition, dependency, and the concrete infrastructures that connect different centers of power.

The classical Westphalian model presents external sovereignty as non interference among equal states. In reality, the picture has always been more entangled. Economic and security arrangements, shared standards, and environmental limits all shape what any one actor can do. Yet the idea of mutual recognition still structures international life. Borders and jurisdictions may be contested, but they matter because other actors agree, or refuse, to treat them as real.

Networked systems have their own version of external sovereignty. Protocols federate or remain closed. Platforms decide whether to interoperate or to wall off data. A messaging standard may span organizations that do not otherwise share governance. Each decision sets a boundary between “inside” and “outside,” and opens channels through which influence can move. These choices are not neutral. They define how external pressures can act on the people inside a system.

Dependence can both empower and constrain. A state that joins a trading bloc may sacrifice unilateral control in exchange for stability and leverage. A protocol that adopts a common format may give up some freedom to change interfaces but gain a richer ecosystem. Network effects can also turn into a subtle form of coercion. Exit may exist in principle but be infeasible in practice because too many relationships depend on the existing structure. External sovereignty is therefore not about isolation. It is about the form of interdependence.

## Accountability as Reciprocal Control

Sovereignty describes who may decide. Accountability describes how those decisions remain aligned with the people they affect. It is tempting to treat accountability as a vague moral demand. We can instead treat it as a concrete structure. Two conditions are essential. Institutions must be answerable, and people must have ways to enforce that answerability.

Answerability involves explanation and attribution. Institutions must be able to say who did what, according to which rule, and for what reason. This is more than public relations. It requires access to information, forums where justifications can be tested, and norms that treat affected people as an audience that matters. Without answerability, power operates behind a one way mirror.

Enforcement involves credible means to change or punish behavior that violates shared norms. This can take legal form through courts and formal sanctions. It can take political form through elections and organized opposition. It can also take social form, as refusal, migration, or withdrawal of cooperation. Arendt’s account of power as something that appears when people act in concert is useful here. When mechanisms of enforcement fail, institutions may retain authority on paper but lose power in practice, and turn to violence or manipulation to compensate.

These two conditions are reciprocal. Enforcement without answerability is arbitrary. Answerability without enforcement is empty ritual. In healthy systems the institution regulates participants, and participants regulate the institution. In many global digital systems this reciprocity is weak. Users have little insight into decision making and few tools to correct it. Rebuilding accountability requires us to design mutual control into the structure of our technical systems.

## Network Protocols as Emerging Institutions

Network protocols are often treated as neutral plumbing. They specify packet formats, message flows, and error codes. From an institutional perspective they do something more. They define who can appear, how actors are named, who can talk to whom, and what counts as valid behavior. In doing so they embody a form of rule.

Every protocol encodes decisions about recognition. It sets the terms under which an entity is treated as a participant, a resource, or noise. It defines identifiers and credential systems. It establishes defaults for visibility, persistence, and deletion. These choices shape who is legible and whose actions can have consequences. They have political content even when framed as purely technical trade offs.

Protocols also embody internal sovereignty. Somewhere there is a process for change. It may be a standards committee, a company, a foundation, or a diffuse open source community. That process determines whose voices matter, which interests are privileged, and how conflicts are resolved. Externally, protocols rely on and intersect with other systems, from domain registries to payment rails to state law. These dependencies are channels through which outside authorities can project power into protocol mediated spaces.

These institutional dynamics become visible under stress. A security incident, a large scale abuse pattern, or a contested change in behavior forces the protocol to “decide” in a way that cannot be reduced to pure correctness. People appeal to unwritten norms and to a sense of community. Maintainers exercise discretion that goes far beyond maintenance. In those moments we see that protocols already operate as institutions, whether or not we acknowledge them as such.

## Network Sovereignty and the Construction of Autonomy

Once we recognize protocols as institutions, network sovereignty comes into focus. Network sovereignty names the authority that arises inside protocol defined spaces and the way network native communities relate to other centers of power. It is not a declaration that protocols should replace states. It is a recognition that they already structure important domains of life and that their authority deserves analysis.

The aim of network sovereignty is not sovereign status as an abstract good. The aim is autonomy. Autonomy has an individual dimension, the ability to form and pursue one’s purposes, and a collective dimension, the ability of a group to shape its shared environment. Both depend on the surrounding architecture. A system that widens the field of action while protecting participants from arbitrary interference supports autonomy. One that narrows options or hides control undermines it.

A network institution that supports autonomy will anchor internal sovereignty in ongoing consent, not just in a founding decision. Participants must be able to recognize one another, grant and withdraw legitimacy, and respond to crises without allowing emergency powers to harden into permanent control. Externally, it will engage other systems in ways that expand possibilities while preserving meaningful exit. Forking, migration, and reconfiguration should be costly but possible paths, not empty threats.

Designing with network sovereignty in mind turns protocol work into a form of constitutional work. Choosing identifier schemes, governance mechanisms, and interoperability strategies becomes a way of deciding who counts, who rules, and how people can resist. The point is not to import the state into code, but to take seriously the fact that code already organizes collective life.

## From Social Form to Digital Constitution

We began from a simple observation. Collective life has taken on a networked shape faster than our institutions have. People already live, argue, and build in digital spaces that cross borders as a matter of course. Yet the structures that govern these spaces often remain opaque, unaccountable, and loosely attached to traditional political concepts.

Network sovereignty offers one way to bring these realities into focus. It links questions of authority, identity, and accountability to the design of digital architectures. It invites us to see protocols and platforms as institutional experiments rather than neutral tools. It allows us to use political theory and historical experience to reason about new technical forms.

The task is not to abandon older institutions, nor to romanticize digital ones. It is to recognize that the space of collective self determination has expanded. If we ignore the sovereign qualities of our networked systems, we hand that space to unexamined power. If we attend to them, we can begin to build digital constitutions that reflect the complexity of our actual attachments and give people a more substantive right to exist, and to act, online.
