//! Test Effects Utilities
//!
//! Standard factory functions for creating Effects instances for testing.
//! This eliminates the most common duplication pattern found across 29 test files.

/// Create deterministic test effects with a seed and timestamp
/// 
/// This is the most common pattern, used for reproducible tests.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `seed` - Random seed for deterministic randomness  
/// * `timestamp` - Fixed timestamp for deterministic time
/// 
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// let effects = test_effects_deterministic(42, 1000);
/// let random_bytes = effects.random_bytes::<32>();
/// let now = effects.now().unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(now, 1000);
/// ```

/// 
/// Uses a standard seed (42) and timestamp (1000) for basic testing.
pub fn test_effects() -> Effects {
    Effects::test()

/// Create named test effects for debugging
/// 
/// Useful when you need to identify which test created the effects.
/// 
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// let effects = test_effects_named("test_account_creation");
/// ```

/// 
/// Uses real system time and randomness, should only be used when
/// testing actual production behavior.

/// Create effects with a specific timestamp
/// 
/// Useful when you need a specific time for testing time-dependent logic.
