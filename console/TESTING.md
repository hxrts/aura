# Testing Strategy for Aura Dev Console

This document outlines the testing approach for the Aura Dev Console, including current test coverage and future testing plans.

## Current Test Status

### [OK] Completed Testing

1. **Manual Testing**: All components have been manually tested during development
2. **Scenario Validation**: Example scenarios have been validated for correct TOML syntax
3. **WebSocket Integration**: WebSocket communication has been tested with live servers
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
5. **Documentation Testing**: All documentation examples have been verified

### ðŸš§ Planned Testing (Future Implementation)

The following tests are outlined but not yet implemented due to the complexity of setting up WASM testing infrastructure:

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing for Leptos components
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end WebSocket communication testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Timeline rendering with large datasets
4. **Automated Browser Testing**: Headless browser automation
5. **Scenario Execution Testing**: Automated scenario validation

## Future Test Implementation

### Unit Testing Framework

```rust
// Example unit test structure for future implementation
#[cfg(test)]
mod component_tests {
    use leptos::*;
    use wasm_bindgen_test::*;
    
    #[wasm_bindgen_test]
    fn test_timeline_component() {
        // Test timeline component rendering
        // This would require Leptos testing utilities
    }
    
    #[wasm_bindgen_test] 
    fn test_state_inspector() {
        // Test state inspector functionality
        // Mock data and verify UI updates
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing Framework

```rust
// Example integration test for WebSocket communication
#[cfg(test)]
mod integration_tests {
    use tokio_test;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_websocket_protocol() {
        // Start mock WebSocket server
        // Connect console client
        // Send test messages
        // Verify responses
    }
}
```

### Automated Browser Testing

```javascript
// Example Playwright test for future implementation
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('console loads and displays correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:8080');
  
  // Verify header displays
  await expect(page.locator('.header')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Verify mode switcher works
  await page.click('[data-testid="live-mode-button"]');
  await expect(page.locator('.network-view')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Test Data and Fixtures

### Mock Scenarios

Test scenarios are available in `scenarios/` (top-level directory) for manual testing:

1. **dkd-basic.toml**: Simple DKD demonstration
2. **byzantine-resharing.toml**: Complex Byzantine behavior testing
3. **recovery-flow.toml**: Social recovery process testing
4. **network-partition.toml**: Network resilience testing

### Mock WebSocket Data

For testing WebSocket communication:

```json
{
  "message_type": "simulation_event",
  "payload": {
    "event_type": "dkd_request",
    "device": "alice",
    "app_id": "test_app",
    "context": "test_context"
  },
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

## Testing Tools and Dependencies

### Required for Future Test Implementation

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
# WASM testing
wasm-bindgen-test = "0.3"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"

# Async testing
tokio-test = "0.4"

# Mock servers
wiremock = "0.5"

# Browser automation (requires external setup)
# playwright or selenium WebDriver
```

### External Dependencies

1. **Playwright**: For automated browser testing
2. **WebDriver**: Alternative to Playwright
3. **Mock WebSocket Server**: For integration testing
4. **Test Runner**: For coordinating test execution

```bash
# Start development server
cd console
trunk serve

# Open browser and test manually
open http://localhost:8080

# Test with different scenarios
# Test mode switching
# Test WebSocket connection
```

### Automated Testing (Future)

```bash
# Run unit tests
wasm-pack test --chrome --headless

# Run integration tests
cargo test --features integration-tests

# Run browser tests
npx playwright test

# Run all tests
npm run test:all
```
