# Verification Traces

This directory contains ITF (Informal Trace Format) trace files generated by Quint simulations.

## What are ITF traces?

ITF traces are JSON files that record the sequence of states a Quint specification passes through during simulation. Each trace captures:
- Initial state
- Sequence of actions taken
- State after each action
- Variable values at each step

## What generates these files?

### Quint Simulations

The `quint run` command with `--out-itf` generates trace files:

```bash
quint run verification/quint/demo_flow.qnt \
  --out-itf verification/quint/traces/full_demo.itf.json \
  --max-steps 50
```

### Rust Integration Tests

The test `verification_demo_itf` in `crates/aura-terminal/tests/verification_demo_itf.rs` runs Quint simulations and writes traces here for conformance testing against Rust implementations.

## File naming conventions

- `{spec_name}.itf.json` - Single trace from a specification
- `{spec_name}_{seq}.itf.json` - Multiple traces with sequence numbers

## Usage

Traces are used for:
1. **Conformance testing** - Verify Rust implementations match Quint specs
2. **Debugging** - Inspect state transitions when tests fail
3. **Documentation** - Understand protocol behavior through concrete examples

## Note

This directory may be empty in fresh checkouts. Trace files are generated on-demand by tests and scripts. The directory must exist for Quint's `--out-itf` to work.
